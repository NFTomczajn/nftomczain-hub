# The Manifesto of NFTomczain

**I don’t have a real laptop.**  
**I also don’t have a fully functional body.**  
**But I have a Raspberry Pi, 0.0043 ETH, and time.**

That was enough to write this manifesto.  
Typed with one hand, processed through dusty memory,  
squeezed between rehab sessions and a morgue fridge breakdown.

## Memory

I don’t trust my short-term memory.  
It freezes too often, like a BIOS with a faulty RAM stick.  
But I remember everything that hurt.  
Everything the system chose to forget.

---

## Reality

My hardware is salvaged.  
The OS – stitched together.  
Support – divided by welfare percentages.

I was forced into minimalism.  
I turned it into a weapon.

## NFTomczain

I’m not an influencer.  
I’m not a brand.  
I’m a person whose manifesto wouldn’t fit into a tweet.

I am NFTomczain –  
A non-fungible, non-silenceable token,  
with a soul signed by electronic breath.

## User Manual

1. Don’t ignore people just because they speak slowly, strangely, or sarcastically.  
2. If someone’s typing on a Raspberry Pi with a Bluetooth keyboard – read what they wrote.  
3. When you see a manifesto signed "NFTomczain", know it’s not a project –  
   it’s a **survival proof**.
